# diode-of-life
An implementation of Conway's Game of Life in the Scala Diode framework

This is an exploration of the Diode architecture by implementing Conway's game of life https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

Life seems like a good thing to start with as the rules are quite simple, the step-by-step update is easy to understand, but there are extra
features we can add as we go along, like varying the step rate, pausing and stepping forward and back, and setting up a board
by hand.
